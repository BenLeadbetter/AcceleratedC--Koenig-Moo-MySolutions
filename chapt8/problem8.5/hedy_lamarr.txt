Hedy Lamarr (/ˈheɪdi/; born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler, November 9, 1914 – January 19, 2000) was an Austrian-born American film actress and inventor.[1]

After a brief early film career in Czechoslovakia, including the controversial Ecstasy (1933), she fled from her husband, a wealthy Austrian ammunition manufacturer, and secretly moved to Paris. Traveling to London,[2] she met Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio head Louis B. Mayer, who offered her a movie contract in Hollywood, where she became a film star from the late 1930s to the 1950s.[3] Among Lamarr's best known films are Algiers (1938), Boom Town (1940), I Take This Woman (1940), Comrade X (1940), Come Live With Me (1941), H.M. Pulham, Esq. (1941), and Samson and Delilah (1949).[4]

At the beginning of World War II, she and composer George Antheil developed a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes that used spread spectrum and frequency hopping technology to defeat the threat of jamming by the Axis powers.[5] Although the US Navy did not adopt the technology until the 1960s,[6] the principles of their work are incorporated into Bluetooth technology and are similar to methods used in legacy versions of CDMA and Wi-Fi.[7][8][9] This work led to their induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.[5][10]
